# 0.0.4

* Adjusted Experimental Mode touch point so that it happens to work on offroad too as the experimental mode switch in settings is at the same place.
* Lowered lamp light brightness to minimum to try to match pre-existing car interior lights and prevent distracting point lights.
* Refactored some HID calls to `usb_multitouch` for future upstreaming to wagimator/MCU_Templates.
* Adjusted clock speed from 16Mhz to 6Mhz. Lights and touch functionality still preserved. Power usage now cut down to somewhere below 0.100mA.

# 0.0.3

* Moved the center button to touch slightly left of center for navigational UI compatiability.

# 0.0.2

* Renamed to C3 Faux-Touch Keyboard to prevent confusion with "TouchKey", an unrelated functionality.

# 0.0.1

* Initial release
